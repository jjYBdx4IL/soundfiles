# soundfiles

Collection of free sound effects files.

## Sound Format

The desired sound format is ogg vorbis to save space and avoid licensing issues.

## LICENSES

All files below src/main/resources/com/github/jjYBdx4IL/audio/soundfiles/pd are in the public domain.

Further directories for compatible licenses may be added.

For credits and required documentation have a look at the VCS log. Currently, a git log dump is included with
every build.

If you want to contribute files, please respect the license demands of the sound file's author(s). This project's aim
is to include only files that do not require changes to dependent programs or restrict them or their licensing in any
way. However, we cannot give any guarantees of course.
